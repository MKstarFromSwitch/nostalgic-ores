# Nostalgic Ores

Modrinth decided to keep my project under review and never let me post it. I'm here now.

This resource pack for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.4 reverts all ore textures to the old ones.

Most of the imported ores were from 1.8.9, and some were from 1.16.

(Copper Ore was not textured, and Ancient Debris + Nether Gold Ore might be the same, not good at modeling btw.)

# Tutorial

1. Press Win+R, then type %appdata% and hit Enter.
2. Go into ".minecraft", then into "resourcepacks".
3. Copy the zip you downloaded without extracting it.
4. Paste it.
5. Go into Minecraft.
6. Enable the resource pack.
7. You're done!
